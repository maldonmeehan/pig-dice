#### _Re-creating the game of Pig Dice _

#### By _**Maldon Meehan**_ and _**Sam Park**_


## Description

_This website will be a Pig Dice game._
_The rules of Pig Dice are:_
* Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that round and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
